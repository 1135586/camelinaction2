Chapter19 - JBoss Tools for Apache Camel
----------------------------------------

19.1.1 JBoss Tools for Apache Camel

This is a Camel example used to demonstrate the JBoss Tools for Apache Camel editor (formerly known as Fuse IDE),
which you can run from Eclipse.


### Installing JBoss Tools for Apache Camel in Eclipse

TODO: This is harder


### Using the editor

Open the `camel-context.xml` XML file which has the Camel route.

You can now use the graphical drag'n'drop editor to edit the EIP patterns.
The editor is 2-way editor, so you can always edit the XML source directly, and switch over
to the graphical editor, and continue editing. There is no lock-in.
